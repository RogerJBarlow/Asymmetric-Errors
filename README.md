# Asymmetric-Errors

Code for error manipulations with asymmetric errors

Programs are given in R and in root

Different procedures are done for 'statistical' and 'systematic' errors.
See and arXiv:physics/0406120 and arXiv:physics/0401042 respectively

Files are:

1. asymmetric-statistical.R

2. asymmetric-systematic.R

3. asymmetric-statistical.root

4. asymmetric-systematic.root

The files are quite short and should be self-explanatory
